This project is to give a rough idea of how you would use NHibernate or your choice of persistence framework with ServiceStack, rather than OrmLite/Redis.

This isn't to show best practice or naming conventions or anything like that, it's simply to help those who have asked me and other people in https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/servicestack how to get started.
